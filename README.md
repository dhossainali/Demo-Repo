| Based on the information provided, Bob puts the ball in the cup in the kitchen and carries the cup to the bedroom. Then, he turns the cup upside down in the bedroom and walks to the garden. Since he left the cup in the garden and not the ball, the ball is still in the cup in the bedroom. | I agree with Expert 1's analysis. Bob indeed left the cup in the garden, not the ball. Therefore, the ball must still be in the cup in the bedroom. | I concur with the previous experts. The ball is in the cup in the bedroom. |
